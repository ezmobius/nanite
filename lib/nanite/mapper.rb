module Nanite
  # Mappers are control nodes in nanite clusters. Nanite clusters
  # can follow peer-to-peer model of communication as well as client-server,
  # and mappers are nodes that know who to send work requests to agents.
  #
  # Mappers can reside inside a front end web application written in Merb/Rails
  # and distribute heavy lifting to actors that register with the mapper as soon
  # as they go online.
  #
  # Each mapper tracks nanites registered with it. It periodically checks
  # when the last time a certain nanite sent a heartbeat notification,
  # and removes those that have timed out from the list of available workers.
  # As soon as a worker goes back online again it re-registers itself
  # and the mapper adds it to the list and makes it available to
  # be called again.
  #
  # This makes Nanite clusters self-healing and immune to individual node
  # failures.

    # Initializes a new mapper and establishes
    # AMQP connection. This must be used inside EM.run block or if EventMachine reactor
    # is already started, for instance, by a Thin server that your Merb/Rails
    # application runs on.
    #
    # Mapper options:
    #
    # identity    : identity of this mapper, may be any string
    #
    # format      : format to use for packets serialization. Can be :marshal, :json or :yaml or :secure.
    #               Defaults to Ruby's Marshall format. For interoperability with
    #               AMQP clients implemented in other languages, use JSON.
    #
    #               Note that Nanite uses JSON gem,
    #               and ActiveSupport's JSON encoder may cause clashes
    #               if ActiveSupport is loaded after JSON gem.
    #
    #               Also using the secure format requires prior initialization of the serializer, see
    #               SecureSerializer.init
    #
    # log_level   : the verbosity of logging, can be debug, info, warn, error or fatal.
    #
    # agent_timeout   : how long to wait before an agent is considered to be offline
    #                   and thus removed from the list of available agents.
    #
    # log_dir    : log file path, defaults to the current working directory.
    #
    # console     : true tells mapper to start interactive console
    #
    # daemonize   : true tells mapper to daemonize
    #
    # pid_dir     : path to the directory where the agent stores its pid file (only if daemonized)
    #               defaults to the root or the current working directory.
    #
    # offline_redelivery_frequency : The frequency in seconds that messages stored in the offline queue will be retrieved
    #                                for attempted redelivery to the nanites. Default is 10 seconds.
    #
    # persistent  : true instructs the AMQP broker to save messages to persistent storage so that they aren't lost when the
    #               broker is restarted. Default is false. Can be overriden on a per-message basis using the request and push methods.
    #
    # secure      : use Security features of rabbitmq to restrict nanites to themselves
    #
    # prefetch    : Sets prefetch (only supported in RabbitMQ >= 1.6)
    # callbacks   : A set of callbacks to have code executed on specific events, supported events are :register,
    #               :unregister and :timeout. Parameter must be a hash with the corresponding events as keys and
    #               a block as value. The block will get the corresponding nanite's identity and a copy of the   
    #               mapper
    #
    # Connection options:
    #
    # vhost    : AMQP broker vhost that should be used
    #
    # user     : AMQP broker user
    #
    # pass     : AMQP broker password
    #
    # host     : host AMQP broker (or node of interest) runs on,
    #            defaults to 0.0.0.0
    #
    # port     : port AMQP broker (or node of interest) runs on,
    #            this defaults to 5672, port used by some widely
